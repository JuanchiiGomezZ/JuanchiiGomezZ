# Hey! I'm Juan Manuel 👋

**AI Native Developer** based in Spain 🇪🇸

I'm obsessed with building. I love turning ideas into real products — coding is not just my job, it's what I genuinely enjoy doing every day.

Currently working at **Globant** building frontend experiences for Iberia. Previously shipped products at **Punto Dev** (led frontend for WITAPS & Uniite) and **Fudi Club** (React Native).

## 🚀 What I Do

I leverage AI coding tools like **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and **Antigravity** to ship projects at startup speed. Always building, always learning.

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind
- **Backend**: Node.js, NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, AWS, Figma

## 🔥 Side Projects

I'm constantly building side projects and experimenting with new ideas. Check out my latest work at [juanmanuelgomez.dev](https://juanmanuelgomez.dev)
